          I actually really have no idea what to put here... I'm a web/software developer who has been called adaptable by some, and overly stubborn by others. I'm constantly trying to learn different languages because every language has it's benefits and detriments. One of the projects I'm working on currently is being written in C#, however I thought VB.net shared more with it. So I built the application around a text box with an input. Only to find out that there's no input available in a text box... at least not by default!
